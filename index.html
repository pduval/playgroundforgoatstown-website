									<h2>Some Background Info</h2>
								</div>
								<p>
									A large number of young children live in the Goatstown Area. All the local schools are continuously oversubscribed. 
									Even the Department of Education has recognised the growth of the very young population in the Goatstown area by the opening of a new school this September.
								</p>
								<p>
									Despite the large number of young children, there is no playground within walking distance.
								</p>
								<p>
									Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, and many of our local councillors, are in favour of a local playground being built. 
									<strong>However we need emails from local residents to prove the level of support.</strong>
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-6">
								<h2>What We Are Looking For</h2>
								<p>
									We want a SMALL local playground within walking distance. The council has specified it would be a small playground, with a maximum of 5 or 6 pieces, one of which will be a disabled swing. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The playground will be intended mostly for 2 to 6 year olds, with one larger piece for slightly older kids. 
									It will be fenced, with a gate. No bin facilities will be provided.
								</p>
							
								<h2>A Focal Point for Families</h2>
								<p>
									Playgrounds act as focal points where parents, and grandparents, of young children can meet.
								</p>
								<p>
									A local playground is a place where local families meet, chat, and build a strong sense of community in an area. A sense of community/place is something the Goatstown Local Area Plan mentions as being generally lacking in the area.
								</p>
								
								<blockquote style="font-size:14px;font-style:italic;">
									...there  appears  to  be  an  overall lack of identity or sense of place associated with the general Goatstown area. 
									<br/><span style="font-size:12px;"><a href="http://www.dlrcoco.ie/sites/default/files/atoms/files/goatstown.pdf" target="_blank">Goatstown Local Area Plan 2012-2018</a> (p.1)</span>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
								The Council/ Planners have an admirable vision for the area. Something a local playground would help achieve.
								</p>
								<blockquote style="font-size:14px;font-style:italic;">
									In planning terms the overall vision for the area is to create a distinctive and vibrant urban village that is an attractive place to live and socialise underpinned by a high standard of urban design, smarter public transport and a range of community, social and local retail facilities.

									A local playground that families can walk to is a very modest ambition. 
									The space for a playground exists in our area, and the funds and the support are there. Why not build it?

								<h2>Benefits of Outdoor Play</h2>
								<p>
									The importance of outdoor play cannot be overemphasised. Childhood obesity is a growing problem, one the government is attempting to tackle. 
									Walk to School campaigns and Healthy Eating policies are now the norm in most schools.
								</p>
								<p>									
									As well as the obvious physical benefits there are also social benefits. 
									Kids meet, interact with one another, and make friends at playgrounds. Local kids playing with their friends at the local playground? A very modest ambition.
								</p>
								<h2>Location</h2>
								<p>We are open to the playground being located in any location within walking distance that the council deems appropriate. 
								The <a href="http://www.dlrcoco.ie/sites/default/files/atoms/files/goatstown.pdf" target="_blank">Goatstown Local Area Plan 2012-2018</a> (p.12) has highlighted Taney Green as the most appropriate area. The council still holds this viewpoint.
								<blockquote style="font-size:14px;font-style:italic;">
									The area would benefit 
									from additional playground provision given the predominance 
									of family-size dwelling houses. The established open space 
									area at Taney Crescent has been identified for such a facility.  
									<br/><span style="font-size:12px;"><a href="http://www.dlrcoco.ie/sites/default/files/atoms/files/goatstown.pdf" target="_blank">Goatstown Local Area Plan 2012-2018</a> (p.12)</span>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									The council feels so strongly about this, that <strong>the building of a playground on this site is even a specific Objective in the Local Area Plan</strong>. 
									Having something stated as an "Objective" in the Local Area Plan is a very strong statement, and means it is something the council is very keen to see achieved.
								</p>
								<blockquote style="font-size:14px;font-style:italic;">
									OS2: It is an 
									objective of the Plan to provide or facilitate a 
									children's playground and / or multi-use games area on the 
									established open space area bounded by Taney Crescent  
									and Taney Avenue.

								<h2>Maintenance and Anti-social Behaviour</h2>
								<p>
									The council will visit it once a week for maintenance. 
									It is our intention that the families using the playground will take "ownership" of it. For example we plan on initiating boundary planting, flower boxes etc. 
								</p>
								<p>
									We have spoken to the Garda&iacute; in Dundrum, and despite rumours to the contrary, they have assured us that they do not foresee that this playground will generate any out of the ordinary anti-social behaviour. 
									In fact they are very supportive of the idea of a playground in this location. 
									The Dundrum Garda&iacute; do a great job, and have stated that if any issues do arise, they want to assure us that they that will be dealt with promptly and efficiently.
